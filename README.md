# Multi LMM Playground

## Project Overview
The **Multi LMM Playground** is an innovative web application built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, designed to explore and evaluate large language models (LMMs). This platform allows users to interact with various AI models, analyze their inference times, and estimate their associated costs. By integrating with **Hugging Face APIs**, the Multi LMM Playground empowers developers to test and compare AI models seamlessly, ensuring they can select the most suitable models for their use cases.

The project also leverages **TailwindCSS** for modern styling and **Redux** for robust state management.

## Research Goals and Purpose

The Multi LMM Playground is more than just a demo application—it's a **research tool** aimed at solving critical challenges in AI development and integration:

### **Key Objectives**
1. **Comparing Multiple Models**  
   Developers often struggle to choose the right AI model for their application. This platform provides a unified space to evaluate and compare different models across:
   - **Performance Metrics**: Analyze latency, throughput, and accuracy.
   - **Inference Costs**: Calculate API costs for each interaction.
   - **Specialization**: Understand the strengths of each model for specific use cases.

2. **Reducing Development Friction**  
   By integrating multiple models under one platform, developers can:
   - Quickly test different models without needing to set up individual APIs.
   - Experiment with different configurations and prompts.
   - Use helper utilities for generating consistent results.

3. **Supporting Research and Prototyping**  
   The playground is designed to support AI researchers, students, and developers in quickly testing cutting-edge models. The ability to easily switch between models enables iterative experimentation and rapid prototyping.

4. **Simplifying Cost Analysis**  
   Understanding the financial implications of using specific AI models is critical for businesses. The platform provides tools to estimate API usage costs, helping teams make cost-effective decisions.

## How to Run the Project

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### **Steps**
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd multi-lmm-playground
   ```

2.	Install dependencies:

      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

3.	Run the development server:

      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```


> The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.


4.	Build the project for production:

      ```bash
      npm run build
      ```

This will generate optimized files in the .next directory.

5.	Start the production server:

      ```bash
      npm run start
      ```

### How to Add a Model in aiModelData.tsx

To add a new AI model:
	1.	Open the aiModelData.tsx file in the src/config directory.
	2.	Add an object to the models array with the following structure:

      ```
      {
         id: 'unique_model_id',
         name: 'Model Name',
         image: 'path to image',
         model: 'Hugging Face model name',
      }
      ```

#### Example:

      ```
      {
         id: 1,
         name: 'QwenAI 2.5',
         image: '/qwen-icon.png',
         model: 'Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct',
      }
      ```

	3.	Save the file and restart the server to reflect the changes.
